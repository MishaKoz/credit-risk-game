    #### 1️⃣ Number of Past Delinquencies  
    If a person has missed payments in the past, it’s a red flag for lenders.  
    The more late payments they have, the higher the risk that they might default again.  
    Even a single missed payment can significantly affect their creditworthiness.

    #### 2️⃣ Age  
    Younger borrowers (under 30) tend to have less financial experience and less stable income.  
    They may take more risks or mismanage debt. Older individuals usually have more stable finances and are considered lower-risk.

    #### 3️⃣ Education Level  
    Higher education often correlates with better financial knowledge and responsibility.  
    Educated borrowers are more likely to understand loan terms and make sound financial decisions, reducing their risk of default.

    #### 4️⃣ Place of Residence  
    People living in more affluent or economically stable areas typically have better access to employment and higher income levels.  
    This environment reduces their overall financial risk compared to individuals in more disadvantaged regions.

    #### 5️⃣ Employment Stability  
    Borrowers with long-term, stable jobs are less likely to experience income shocks.  
    A steady job history gives lenders confidence that the person can maintain regular loan payments.

    ##### To refresh the memory:
    
    Collateral helps reduce losses by backing the loan with an asset.

    - **Real estate** generally has high recovery value → lower LGD  
    - **Vehicles** or **consumer goods** lose value quickly → higher LGD  
    - **Unsecured loans** (no collateral) → very high LGD

    Better collateral leads to higher recovery and therefore lower LGD.

    **LTV** is the ratio of the loan amount to the value of the collateral:

    - A high LTV (e.g. 90%) means the loan is close to or exceeds the asset's value → higher LGD

    ### What does EAD include?

    - The **current outstanding balance** on the loan — money already drawn by the borrower.  
    - **Undrawn credit limits or credit lines** — potential amounts the borrower may draw before defaulting.  
    - For some loans, like mortgages, EAD typically equals the outstanding balance, as no additional amounts are usually drawn.

    ---

    ### Why is accurate EAD estimation important?

    1. **Risk assessment accuracy:**  
       Underestimating EAD leads to underestimating potential losses and insufficient capital reserves.

    2. **Regulatory compliance:**  
       Basel II and III require precise EAD calculation for capital adequacy.

    3. **Different approaches for different loan types:**  
       - For **revolving credits** (credit cards, lines of credit), estimating likely usage of undrawn limits is critical.  
       - For **term loans** (mortgages, auto loans), EAD often equals the current balance.

    ---

    ### How is EAD estimated?

    - **Historical borrower behavior:**  
      Analyzing past usage patterns before defaults.

    - **Statistical models:**  
      Logistic regression and other techniques to predict likely future drawings.

    - **Expert judgement and macroeconomic factors:**  
      Adjustments based on broader economic outlooks.

    ---

    ### Practical examples

    $$
    EAD = Used + Utilisation Rate * Limit-Used
    $$
    
    - **Credit card:**  
      Limit: \$10,000  
      Used: \$7,000  
      Estimated usage of undrawn limit before default(Utilisation Rate): 80% of \$3,000  

    $$
    EAD = 7,000 + 0.8 \\times 3,000 = 9,400
    $$

    - **Mortgage loan:**  
      Outstanding balance: \$150,000  
      No additional drawings expected.  

    $$
    EAD = 150,000
    $$

    ---

    ### Important notes

    - **Collateral impact:**  
        EAD measures gross exposure; collateral affects LGD instead.

    - **Netting agreements:**  
        Offsetting exposures may reduce effective EAD.

    ## 📘 Theory: How PD, LGD, and EAD Shape Loan Terms

    Banks don't only assess **credit risk** to decide whether to approve a loan — they also use it to set **loan conditions**: interest rate, loan amount, duration, and collateral.

    1 more time:

    - **PD (Probability of Default):** Likelihood that a borrower will default.
    - **LGD (Loss Given Default):** Expected loss if default happens, after recoveries.
    - **EAD (Exposure at Default):** Total value the bank is exposed to at the moment of default.

    > — *Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), 2017*
    
    > “Banks seek to maximize risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC), which depends on how efficiently they manage credit risk exposures through pricing and structure.”

    ## 🧮 Example Mapping of Risk to Terms

    | Situation                      | Risk Metric Involved   | Impact on Loan Terms                                   |
    |-------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
    | Borrower with high PD         | PD                     | ↑ Interest Rate, ↓ Loan Amount, ↑ Monitoring           |
    | Collateral is low-quality     | LGD                    | ↑ Collateral Required, ↓ Approved Loan-to-Value (LTV)  |
    | High exposure amount          | EAD                    | ↓ Loan Limit, Shorter Term, Stricter Conditions        |
    | High Expected Loss (EL)       | PD×LGD×EAD             | Rejection or Significantly Higher Interest             |

    ---

    ## 🔬 Real-World Application

    Banks simulate different scenarios using **credit scoring models**, and then match borrowers into **risk buckets** (e.g. low, medium, high risk). These buckets are tied to pricing policies:

    - **Low-risk:** Competitive interest rates, flexible terms.
    - **Medium-risk:** Moderate rates, more documentation, lower limits.
    - **High-risk:** High rates or rejection, unless risk is mitigated with collateral.


    ## 🧠 Beyond EL: Capital and Margin

    Banks also apply:

    - **Capital requirements** → More risky loans require more capital.
    - **Profit margins** → Interest rate must exceed EL + cost of capital.

    Thus, even if a loan is approved, a high EL can mean **less favorable terms** to compensate for the risk.

### How Banks React to Credit Risk

Banks and lenders actively adjust loan conditions based on perceived risk. According to a **BIS Working Paper**,  
> *"A higher risk estimate is associated with higher interest rates,"*  
though the relationship is *"weaker in competitive environments."*  
Even when multiple banks compete for clients, they still penalize risky borrowers with higher pricing.

The **European Central Bank** emphasizes that in times of market stress, the cost of capital rises sharply for weaker firms:  
> *"The expected probability of default rises by 0.2 percentage points, while corporate bond spreads increase by around 70 basis points three weeks after a risk-off shock."*

In terms of environmental risk, a 2023 study cited by the **Financial Times** found:  
> *"Eurozone banks are already factoring in climate-related risks by charging higher interest rates to companies with higher carbon emissions."*  
This so-called *climate premium* leads brown-sector borrowers to pay **up to 0.14 percentage points more** than greener counterparts — especially during periods of monetary tightening.

On the flip side, companies with strong ESG profiles enjoy better terms. According to **Federated Hermes**:  
> *"Companies with better ESG practices tend to have lower CDS spreads, even after controlling for credit risks."*
